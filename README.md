Update is use insde value change
e.g.
update  CUSTOMERS
set     ORDER_PRICE = 4.7
where   FIRST_NAME = 'The' and LAST_NAME = 'Dude'
(Note : If we dont use where then it will automatically change whole column with that value)


Alter for structure change whther you want to add some column or whatere related to table structure

delete from employee where id =10;

Truncate table persons;
it will delete all rows and no where is allowed here

But when we use delete we can use where 

Drop will delete its structure also
